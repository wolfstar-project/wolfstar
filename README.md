## A note to aspiring developers who want to self host WolfStar

The developer team does not support the idea of other self-hosted instances of WolfStar. The team prides itself on providing the best experience and support for the end-users. As such, an offshoot or unaffiliated mirror of WolfStar may cause ill effects on the reputation and image of WolfStar. If you wish to see new features implemented, please refer to the developing guidelines linked above.

In addition, WolfStar was built with a dependence on many services which need consistent maintenance and oversight in order to function and behave properly. These include, but are not limited to,

-   [`InfluxDB`][`InfluxDB`] in order to keep anonymous metrics on bot usage
-   [`PostgreSQL`][`PostgreSQL`] as database
-   Other external APIs, each requiring their own individual API keys.

With this in mind, it is also worth noting that WolfStar will in no way be capable of running on services such as [Glitch] or [Heroku]. A dedicated VPS (Virtual Private Server) is required in order to maintain the proper production environment.

## Story

**A bit of story**: There was Riot the first bot created but never released and before this name “WolfStar” it was called OverWolf was supposed to be released but never wanted to because of time and responsibility to publish and keep it active, my curiostra of programming was because of the first bot I created and thanks to the GiulioAndCommunity guild and recon dev. Thanks to other programmers, since my programming experience was like poor, the name WolfStar is the union of the old bot name and my name
